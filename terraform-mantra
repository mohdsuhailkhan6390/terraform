what is block ?

In Terraform, a block is a fundamental unit for defining and configuring aspects of your infrastructure, written in the HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL).  
Think of blocks as containers holding configurations for things like:
Resources: Defining infrastructure components like servers, networks, or databases.
Providers: Specifying the cloud platform or service you're working with (e.g., AWS, Azure).
Variables: Declaring inputs to customize your infrastructure deployments.
Modules: Encapsulating reusable sets of configurations for efficient management.
Outputs: Defining what information is displayed after Terraform finishes executing. 
Blocks help organize your infrastructure code and make it easier to manage and reuse. 


what is parameter ?

Input variables are like placeholders for values that you want to customize in your Terraform code, such as the size of a server or the name of a resource.
They let you make your infrastructure flexible and reusable without changing the core code.
You define them using the variable block and provide values during the terraform apply process

also add example there
In Terraform, a parameter generally refers to an input variable. These are like placeholders for values that you want to customize in your configuration. 
Example:
1. Define the variable in variables.tf:
terraform
variable "instance_type" {
  description = "The type of instance to create"
  type        = string
  default     = "t2.micro"
}
Use code with caution.

variable "instance_type": Declares an input variable named "instance_type".
description: Provides a description of the variable.
type: Specifies the type of value the variable expects (in this case, a string).
default: Sets a default value if no specific value is provided during terraform apply. 
2. Use the variable in main.tf:
terraform
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  instance_type = var.instance_type
  # other configuration...
}
Use code with caution.

instance_type = var.instance_type: References the value of the instance_type variable using the var. prefix. 
3. Provide a variable value (optional): 
You can provide a different value for the instance_type variable during terraform apply: 
bash
terraform apply -var="instance_type=t2.large"


what is argument?

In Terraform, arguments are settings you define within blocks to configure resources and other infrastructure elements. 
Think of them as:
Key-value pairs: attribute_name = value.
Ingredients and instructions: They tell Terraform how to set up the resource.
Defined within blocks: Like ami and instance_type in a resource "aws_instance" block. 
Example:
terraform
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0abcdef1234567890"  # This is an argument
  instance_type = "t2.micro"             # This is an argument
}
